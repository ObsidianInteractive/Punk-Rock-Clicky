# My-Clicky-Game

### Synopsis
***

A memory testing app I created using React.  The app randomly orders 20 images of different rocks, and everytime you click an image, it randomly shuffles the image.  The goal is to click on as many of the rocks without clicking the same image twice.  The app keeps track of your score, and your topscore, until you refresh or leave the page.  Enjoy!
